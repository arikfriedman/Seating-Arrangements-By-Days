# Seating-Arrangements-By-Days
this application was created as a side project. the goal was to find a correct division of employees into 4 days of the week, during the Covid pandemic. Given a number of rows and columns, and knowing that each employee should come to the office only once a week, the algorithm decides for each employee which day of the week he/she should go to the office, so no employee would sit next to another employee. this algorithm uses a Graph Coloring Algorithm found online.
